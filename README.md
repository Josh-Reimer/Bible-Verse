# Bible-Verse
# An Android app that can generate pseudo-random Bible verses
  I started developing this app on an Android phone running Android 13 in 2022. I used [CodeAssist](https://github.com/tyron12233/CodeAssist) (a mobile app) to edit it at the time and later switched to [AndroidIDE](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE) when i found it. However,as I learned more and most tutorials for Android development were for Android Studio, I soon had to figure Android Studio out. In 2023 I uploaded the project to Github. Then when I built my own pc I pretty much quit using my phone for coding. 
  
  The idea of this app is that it presents a new pseudo-random verse from the King James version Bible every time you open the app. This approach often presents you with a verse that most people would not consider 'inspiring'. However, why would I limit what verse could be presented and therefore limit what inspiration could come from it? 

Verse also has the ability to bring you to the chapter that said random verse is found in and the ability to bookmark verses. Hopefully more features coming soon! (search, share, more Bible versions, etc...)
